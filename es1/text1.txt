in the lep regime at energies electroweak radiative corrections are dominated by large electromagnetic effects from initial state radiation by the contributions of the running electromagentic coupling and by the corrections associated with the rho parameter typically of the order ten per cent future colliders such as the lhc or an ee linear collider lc will explore a new energy range it is known since many years see for instance that above the electroweak scale the structure of the leading electroweak corrections changes and double logarithms of sudakov type as well as single logarithms involving the ratio of the energy to the electroweak scale become dominating these logarithms arise from virtual or real gauge bosons emitted by the initial and final state particles they correspond to the well known soft and collinear singularities observed in theories with massless gauge bosons in massless gauge theories such as qed and qcd the soft and collinear logarithms in the virtual corrections are singular and have to be cancelled by adding the contribution of real gauge boson radiation in the electroweak theory the masses of the weak gauge bosons z and w provide a physical cutoff and the massive gauge bosons can be detected as distinguished particles unlike for the photon real z and w bremsstrahlung need not be included and the large logarithms originating from virtual corrections are of physical significance the typical size of double logarithmic dl and single logarithmic sl corrections is given by
